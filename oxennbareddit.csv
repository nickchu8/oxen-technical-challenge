Just thought it was interesting to hear AD specifically mention the prize money going to the younger guys as being a source of motivation for the rest of the team. 

What's crazy is the NBA will do this for this tournament, sort of sight unseen and unsure of how it will actually play out, and it ends up costing millions, but then the Dunk Contest doesn't get a big prize to try and draw out the big names and stars.",LakerGiraffe,1097,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17votji/mcmenamin_ad_says_500k_sounds_real_good_to_us_its/

""Just watching him control the game, watching how special he is, watching his mind just work over and over again. The way he works, just takes over the game physically but really mentally. It's special.""

""The way he keeps everybody's spirit calm, he really keeps our team-we have a great, confident group already, but his ability, his maturation, his understanding, it really keeps us levelheaded. Never too high, never too low. Constant communicator out there.""

""Like I said, I refuse to take it for granted. Being his teammate, playing against him for many years...when you have something special, you have to enjoy it, because you never know how long you're going to have it, and when it's gone you will truly miss it.""

Absolutely ridiculous efficiency by LeBron so far from everywhere on the court. Even at his age, he’s scoring at the rim at unprecedented efficiency, and he’s shooting more of his shots at the rim than he has since his first season in LA (on 9.5% better shooting). I know it’s been talked about ad nauseam, but this man simply **does not age**.

17w6rvk,2023-11-15 15:04:56,"Subbing Harden for Westbrook has been a huge mistake in the clutch. With Westbrook on floor, there has been higher quality shots and more hustle and movement on defense and offense. With Harden, there has been lower shot quality and less movement on defense and offense. Harden should sub for Norm.","Lue has made a big mistake subbing out Westbrook. Westbrook has changed his game to move off-ball and set picks and get his teammates high quality looks. He also leads the team in hustle with deflections, steals, picks and rebounds. This is the stuff that RoCo and Batum were good at with hustle. Mann and Russ should be in the games at the end to do the dirty work that PG/Kawhi/Harden do not want to do.

I am not saying that Harden cannot play in the clutch. But he probably should be subbing in for someone other than Westbrook/Mann since those two do the dirty work on defense and offense that are necessary to enable high quality looks.

The whole narrative of Russ kills floor-spacing is baloney. Russ has been cutting and standing at dunker spot. All of the shots taken have been high quality with him on the floor. His hustle on defense is super valuable also.

Let's start with the Memphis game that would have been won with Westbrook on the floor.

4th Quarter with Westbrook-On and Harden-off. Clippers down 13 mostly due to Harden-on the floor.

1. Westbrook sets a pick on the [Center to get PJ Tucker a wide open 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=558&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Tucker%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(3%20PTS)%20(George%204%20AST)). You have to have pick setters on offense and it is obvious. If you play PG/Kawhi/Harden, which of the 3 will be constantly setting picks? Probably none?
2. Again solid play design with Russ at dunker spot. Russ's man helps off to guard PG, while Kennard guards Russ. E[asy dunk for Mann](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=566&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Mann%201%27%20Cutting%20Dunk%20Shot%20(7%20PTS)%20(George%205%20AST)).  In offensive sets, you need a guy at the dunker spot. PG/Kawhi/Harden are not going to play that role...
3. [Westbrook in paint position and strips the ball](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=590&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Smart%20Bad%20Pass%20Turnover%20(P5.T14)). These are the hustle plays you need in the clutch.
4. Offensive sets are also simple. Just get PG the ball. [Westbrook tries to get PG](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=592&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20George%2015%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot) a quality look.
5. [PG doesn't even think and pulls up from 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=597&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%2027%27%203PT%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot%20(18%20PTS)%20(Tucker%201%20AST)).  PG can't play this way with Harden/Kawhi since he over-thinks about shooting too much
6. Again [off-ball movement to get Westbrook an open layup](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=605&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Westbrook%203%27%20Cutting%20Layup%20Shot%20(12%20PTS)%20(Powell%203%20AST)). Someone has to cut. 
7. Again [PG doesn't even think and pulls up from 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=609&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%2026%27%203PT%20Step%20Back%20Jump%20Shot%20(21%20PTS)). There is no your turn my turn type of caution when he plays with Kawhi/Harden.
8. [PG tries again but misses. Westbrook is attacking to getting rebounds](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=611&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20George%2016%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot). This is the hustle that's needed.
9. Game is simple. [Westbrook setting picks for PG. Forces switches. Norm has open 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=621&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Powell%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(14%20PTS)%20(George%207%20AST)). Westbrook is also picking Mann's defender.
10. With Westbrook staying in the paint, he forces the defense to stick around him. [Leads to Norm wide open 3.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=626&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Powell%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(17%20PTS)%20(Mann%202%20AST))
11. Gotta be active on rebounding. If [Westbrook doesn't rebound this, JJJ would've gotten it.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=629&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Westbrook%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A1%20Def%3A8))
12. [Westbrook might've fouled Biyombo but he surely wouldn't get the rebound](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=634&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Jackson%20Jr.%207%27%20Cutting%20Layup%20Shot). Hustle plays.
13. Again game is simple. [Russ sets a pick for PG. PG has wide open lane and gets fouled.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=630&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Jackson%20Jr.%20S.FOUL%20(P4.T3)%20(E.Dalen)) High quality shots.
14. [HustleBrook gets fouled trying to rebound.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=644&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Mann%205%27%20Layup)
15. [Big time steal by Westbrook](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=654&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Westbrook%20STEAL%20(3%20STL)). Why would you not keep playing Westbrook?
16. Both Mann and Russ attack the boards. [Mann passes it to Norm for open 2.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=658&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Powell%2019%27%20Jump%20Shot%20(20%20PTS)%20(Mann%203%20AST))
17. Again these are good plays. [Russ is at corner 3 but cuts to get Norm a wide open 3 shot.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=668&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Powell%203PT%20Jump%20Shot)

The whole floor-spacing argument is baloney. All of the shots with Westbrook on the floor has been relatively high shot quality.

So Harden subs in for Westbrook down 98-95. Again it was a 13 point lead earlier cut to 3.

1. Mann gets blocked and Harden is able to get a [wide open 3 off the rebound.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=677&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Mann%205%27%20Layup)  Not sure why Mann forced the issue, and also why Norm passed up the 3. Norm always chucks it with Westbrook on the floor.
2. This is not Harden's fault. But [Kawhi decides to be selfish](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=695&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Leonard%206%27%20Driving%20Layup) and tries to take a tough layup and draw fouls. Didn't happen. What happened to running plays through PG and setting him screens?
3. [Harden just doesn't hustle. He doesn't crash the paint to stop the ball.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=697&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Roddy%201%27%20Driving%20Layup%20(8%20PTS)%20(Smart%207%20AST)) He just lets JJJ box him out.  My guess is you need at least 2-3 players on the court that hustles.
4. Norm is also not that good of a pick setter / hustle player yet. [Harden gets his 3 blocked. Would've been a quality look if Norm could screen](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=699&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Harden%203PT%20Jump%20Shot).
5. [I guess Kawhi wanted to force a shot-up to get a 2 for 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=706&GameID=0022300179&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Leonard%2011%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper)? It's not Harden's fault. But the game seemed simpler with running through Russ/PG and letting Russ set him the pick.

The main issue with these plays above is that there is severe disfunction on offense. The offense was simple in the 15+ plays above. Russ is focused on getting PG looks. He sets picks for PG also and moves off ball. Almost all the shots were relatively open and high quality.

When Harden and Kawhi comes in, shots are being forced up. It's not Harden's fault, but the shots just suck. What are the two shots Kawhi takes that are so contested? Also there is no hustle. Norm/Harden are not hustle players. I would've swapped Harden to do Norm's role.

**Time for the Denver Game**

Tie game to start the 4th.

1. Again Russ is targeting PG. [PG passes up open 3 but leads to PJ open 3.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=475&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Tucker%2024%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(6%20PTS)%20(George%203%20AST))
2. Norm is not a hustle guy. Norm reminds me of Harden. [Not surprised he got beat by Braun.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=477&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Braun%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20(8%20PTS))
3. Offense is easy. [PG knows he has the greenlight to just attack and shoots a layup with 19 seconds](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=478&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%2012%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot%20(25%20PTS)) on shotclock.
4. Norm lost his man for [Braun wide open dunk.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=479&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Braun%201%27%20Cutting%20Dunk%20Shot%20(10%20PTS)%20(Holiday%201%20AST))
5. [Hustlebrook offensive foul but great play to get Mann an open layup.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=490&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Westbrook%20Offensive%20Charge%20Foul%20(P2)%20(J.Tiven))
6. [Russ's active cut leads to Mann being able to find PJ for open 3](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=495&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Tucker%203PT%20Jump%20Shot) or an option to pass to Russ. Hustle.
7. [Missed wide open 3 for PG.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=501&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20George%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot) High quality look.
8. [PG makes a nice mid-range fadeaway](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=512&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%2014%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper%20(27%20PTS)). PG just plays more loose since Harden/Kawhi aren't on the floor and knows he has the greenlight.
9. This play is awesome. Mann and Westbrook cut and hustle on offense. [PG to Mann to Westbrook for the dunk.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=519&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Westbrook%201%27%20Cutting%20Dunk%20Shot%20(8%20PTS)%20(Mann%204%20AST))
10. [Great euro-step by Gordon.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=521&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Gordon%201%27%20Layup%20(13%20PTS)) nothing to do.
11. Again [George had greenlight to drive for the layup](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=522&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%201%27%20Driving%20Layup%20(29%20PTS)). No pressure to think about getting Harden a look.
12. Westbrook sets up George at his spot. [George hits his mid-range.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=531&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=George%2017%27%20Jump%20Shot%20(31%20PTS)%20(Westbrook%203%20AST))
13. Kawhi makes a tough 2. But [watch Westbrook screen PJ Tucker's man Jokic...](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=536&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Leonard%2012%27%20Turnaround%20Fadeaway%20(13%20PTS)) Tucker was wide open.
14. [Kawhi decides to pull-up from 3.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=539&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Leonard%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot) This shot quality is just average. 

Westbrook exits the game up 5. Overall, the shot quality was pretty good because PG had the confidence and greenlight to just attack. Westbrook also hustled to set screens and cut. 

You need guys like Mann/Westbrook together to constantly move off ball and cut.

Now Lue puts in a non-hustle Harden who will ball stop.

1. [Harden stands a 30 foot to pass to George for open 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=554&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20George%2018%27%20Jump%20Shot). It's a good shot. But Harden pretty much can't help on any hustle plays afterwards since he's at 30 feet. He can't go for offensive rebounds. I don't like this play. I rather see Harden have the option to cut after the pass.
2. Play seems weird. H[arden has Gordon but let's Gordon dunk it.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=562&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Gordon%20Tip%20Dunk%20Shot%20(15%20PTS))
3. This is a good play by running the offense through Harden. [Harden to Mann to Powell.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=567&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Powell%2024%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(14%20PTS)%20(Mann%205%20AST))
4. [Harden has to make this layup](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=573&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Harden%201%27%20Driving%20Layup)
5. [Shotclock violation](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=579&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Clippers%20Turnover%3A%20Shot%20Clock%20(T#11)). This never happened with Westbrook in this quarter. The whole taking-turns concept is too complex. Offense was so simple with Westbrook/PG and running it through to PG. 
6. Mann's screen is not the best but [Paul George pulls up for 3 and misses.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=585&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20George%2025%27%203PT%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot)
7. [PG gets fouled.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=587&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Caldwell-Pope%20P.FOUL%20(P3.PN)%20(N.Sago))There's alot of standing around. No one is moving from Harden/Kawhi/Norm.
8. [Mann out of position for Reggie layup](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=593&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Jackson%201%27%20Driving%20Layup%20(18%20PTS)). This doesn't happen to Westbrook in the 4th quarter. 
9. [Spacing is actually bad with Harden](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=597&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=MISS%20Leonard%2015%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper). Kawhi gets doubled but Harden is too close to the other players where Kawhi couldn't make a pass. Bad shot by Kawhi.
10. [Harden and Norm have no defensive awareness](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&CFPARAMS=&GameEventID=599&GameID=0022300024&Season=2023-24&flag=1&title=Gordon%201%27%20Reverse%20Dunk%20(20%20PTS)%20(Jokic%209%20AST)). Gordon easy dunk.

Overall the game was over when Harden was subbed in for Russ. The problem is that there is no off-ball movement on offense, except for Mann. Mann replaced Russ on the picks and cuts. When both were on the floor, Russ sets the picks for PG, while both Mann and Russ are active on setting picks and cuts.

With Harden, he actually hurts the spacing at 3 point line since Norm/Kawhi/PG are standing there and clumped up. When a guy drives, they don't kick-out well. Also, it's better to have someone in the paint setting a pick to open up the wide open 3. Russ was setting picks on centers to get PJ wide open 3 looks. Harden is just standing at the 3 point line. You need someone in the paint setting picks.

The offense is also just a mess. I think Harden could lead the offense and replace PG. But PG plays much better and more confident when he just plays with Russ/Mann. The your-turn / my-turn offense disrupts the rhythm.

If I were Lue, I would replace Harden for Norm. Keep Russ/Mann in to set screens and set screens in the paint. Also have them roam around to cut. You need 2 guys doing this job. You also need Russ/Mann on defense to protect the paint and get steals.",MITWestbrook,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17w6rvk/subbing_harden_for_westbrook_has_been_a_huge/

A lot of people wondered how much he could still score at high efficiency given his 24.5 PPG on 70% TS averages last season

Looks like we've found the tradeoff point with him playing more aggressively due to Murray's injury

It's a lot of fun to see him go to work in the post as Denver's main gameplan now IMO

17vwk7v,2023-11-15 07:50:39,Is RJ Barrett tricking us? An analysis," RJ Barrett is off to a torrid start to the season, but he's had hot stretches before. Barrett is human confirmation bias: even now, in his best season, it’s easy to see precisely what you want to see in Barrett.

Has he really taken a leap this year, or is it simply an earlier-than-usual Barrett heater? I decided to lay out the case for and against the New York Knick with help from Hopeful Hal and Grumpy Gus.

\[As always, I've included a bunch of illustrative video clips that you [can find in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking) or at the link in the comments. Thanks for reading!\]

**Hopeful Hal:** It’s easy to see that Barrett is markedly improved in his fifth year.

Barrett is setting personal marks in points (22.6), assists (3.1), and three-point percentage (50%!) despite playing fewer minutes than he has since his rookie year. Lineups with Barrett have been in [the 95th percentile leaguewide](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574/lineups#tab-four_factors) in both offensive *and* defensive rating; similarly, while on/off stats are unreliable this early in the year, it has to mean *something* that the team is useless on both ends when Barrett is off the court this season.

There could be a reason for his hot start from deep. Barrett reportedly changed his form over the summer, as [analyzed in excruciating detail by The Strickland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfTGnI8WahM&t=334s). Barrett shot 19/51, 37.3%, from the slightly closer FIBA three-point line — not quite his hot start to this season, but still an encouraging sign.

**Grumpy Gus:** He was also just 6-for-21 from deep in the preseason, and he’s been consistently below average throughout his career, so…

**Hopeful Hal:** ***\*coughs\**** It’s the preseason, man! And Barrett hasn’t been shooting unsustainably on closely-guarded shots, either. He’s only even attempted two triples that weren’t considered “open” or “wide open,” speaking to his wiser shot selection.

He’s become better at floating around on the three-point line to open up clean passing lanes from his teammates: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\]

Defenses haven’t adjusted to his accuracy yet, and he’s making them pay with warm-up shots. It’s a win-win: either teams continue to ignore him on the perimeter, so he keeps getting easy looks, or they start guarding him tighter out there, opening up congested driving lanes.

Despite that traffic, Barrett is finishing a career-best [61% of his shots at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-shooting_accuracy) and 41% from floater range, and he is averaging a beastly [1.53 points per transition possession](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/5d9be6e17455336e875c33c8/playtypes?seasonId=651b131d1507a2202c01094c&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1). His right hand looks better than ever, which is a low bar, but he’s looked better going in the devil’s direction, too.

This Knicks team doesn’t exactly provide Barrett a preponderance of space in which to operate. He’s consistently met by a wall of bodies in the paint, so the fact that he’s looked better operating in a crowd — and avoiding the crowd altogether — matters a great deal.

**Grumpy Gus:** Those are all numbers, for sure. If we’re just spewing out stats, it’s worth noting that just [34% of his shots are at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-shooting_frequency), by far a career-low (although admittedly a solid number overall). That’s worked fine, thanks to his incendiary start to the season on threes. But that’s the sort of shift that can tank efficiency stats if the three-point percentage retreats too much.

That tick downward in rack attacks has also caused Barrett to draw fewer free throws — his 4.7 free throw attempts per game would be his fewest since the 2020-21 season.

**Hopeful Hal**: You left out that he’s making a superb 84.8% of his free throws (and went 18-for-21 in the preseason, too!).

But free throws are boring to talk about. The most interesting part of Barrett’s improvement this season is that he’s clearly trying to make quicker decisions. His [2.65 seconds and 2.11 dribbles per touch](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*barrett&Season=2023-24) are by *far* the lowest figures of his career. Interestingly, he never receives the ball on the elbows or in the paint. He’s entirely a perimeter player now, and he’s doing more with less.

Gus, if you don’t remember anything else from this conversation, remember this: his improvement isn’t in the number of “wow” plays; it’s in the lack of woeful ones. There are fewer record scratches, fewer possession-eating dribbles to nowhere.

He still sizes up the defense a tad too long. Nobody will ever accuse RJ Barrett of being a [0.5-second player](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/01/25/celtics-strive-for-split-second-success/). But he’s consistently making the simple passes he missed for so long, and like a magic carpet, it’s opened a whole new world for the Knicks’ offense.

**Grumpy Gus:** Maybe that’s true, but it’s not like he’s creating major advantages with his playmaking: despite his slightly increased assist rate, his *potential* assists are [down from last year](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*barrett&Season=2022-23). This means his tiny uptick in assists is more likely due to teammate shooting luck than any intrinsic passing improvement.

And for all that talk of improved decision-making, his pick-and-roll numbers aren’t great! In 44 P&R possessions, Synergy says he’s only generating .818 points per possession, in the 23rd percentile. Those are way down from last year.

**Hopeful Hal:** 44 possessions are barely worth looking at, and the eye test says that Barrett’s passing *is* better (do you even watch the games, Gus?). He’s showing a new command of the pick-and-roll, putting defenders on his back and consistently showing vision he rarely did before. Watch the patience here as Barrett waits for Isaiah Hartenstein to free up before delivering a nice little pocket pass: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\].

The Knicks have integrated a little more movement into Barrett’s role, too, and he’s been involved in more hand-offs than ever before (at the expense of spot-up opportunities). He’s taking and making right-handed layups, which is new, and his floater game is developing nicely. I’ll take a teardrop runner over driving in a straight line into the wall of defenders ignoring Julius Randle and flinging up an ugly lefty layup!

**Grumpy Gus**: You know what I would take? A rebound. It would be great if Barrett didn’t consistently miss box-outs and deigned to grab a defensive board.

**Hopeful Hal**: It’s still early, and that’ll stabilize. If you want to talk about regression, remember that Barrett has never averaged fewer than four defensive rebounds. I doubt he’ll start now (although, yes, the box-outs would be nice).

Despite the lack of boards, Barrett’s defense has improved this season! RJ’s been better on the ball than ever before, and if not lockdown, certainly above-average. He has solid physical tools and is usually in the right spots at the right times. The team doesn’t hesitate to put him on elite wings — he credibly guarded Jayson Tatum ([allowing just 1-for-5 shooting](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629628/head-to-head?dir=D&sort=SECONDS) as the closest defender) in their opening night matchup, and he also did well against Paul George and Brandon Ingram, among others. Here he is sticking with Tatum and forcing a difficult floater: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\]

It’s only been seven games, but it’s worth noting that his foul rate has been impossibly low — he’s only averaging 1.1 lawbreaks per game. Foul avoidance is an underrated part of playing strong defense.

**Grumpy Gus:** He never fouls because he never takes risks! Not to sound like a casual, but it would be nice if he’d make a defensive highlight at some point. Barrett remains one of the league’s least effective defensive playmakers — his [block and steal rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-defense_rebounding) are perpetually among the league’s worst, as [we talked about a bit here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/haikus-and-more-2023-24-eastern-conference), and he only averages [1.1 deflections per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*andre%20&Season=2023-24). The Bucks’ rookie, Andre Jackson Jr., has averaged 1.3 deflections across his six games and only plays *eight minutes* per contest!

While I concede his on-ball defense has been positionally solid, off the ball, he still looks like a man without a map. Watch him get so lost that he literally spins like a top while trying to find his elusive mark: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\]

Even if the Knicks' defensive numbers look great when he’s on the court, that’s due primarily to teams shooting [an abysmal 29% from three ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574/lineups#tab-shooting_defense_fg)while Barrett’s out there. I doubt he’s single-handedly forcing opponents to shoot like my nephew’s grade-school team.

**Hopeful Hal:** You have a nephew??? Anyway, you take what improvement you can get. This is perhaps the best Barrett has looked on that end and the first time I can confidently say he’s been a defensive asset overall.

Look: we’re diving deep into the weeds without acknowledging that he’s been, to this point, consistent and reliable. He’s scored 24 or 26 points in five of his seven games, and the team is 5-2 when he plays (including a feisty season-opening loss to Boston). Some three-point regression is coming, for sure. But Barrett has looked like a new man since last year’s playoffs. While the shooting determines his ceiling, the defense determines his floor, and right now, his floor at least requires some stairs to reach.

Finally, it’s worth remembering that Barrett is doing all this on a balky knee he tweaked in the first game of the season after a ferocious dunk. If that heals up, he could be even more effective around the rim and defensively.

**Grumpy Gus**: Or it could linger all —.

**Hopeful Hal**: I’m gonna stop you there. No bad juju today.

Is Barrett for real this season? He isn’t going to be *this* good all year long, but there are genuine reasons to believe he’s made incremental improvements as a decision-maker and as an on-ball defender. We’ve already seen him shine in the playoffs, and he looks even better now. If the shooting touch stays solid, Barrett could become the third-best player on a contending team — if he’s not there already.

**Grumpy Gus**: He’s not there already, and that’s a Garden-sized “if.” There’s a world of difference between Barrett ending up as, say, a 39% shooter from deep versus plateauing as a 35% shooter (which would still be the second-highest mark of his career, mind you). 39% opens up driving lanes for Barrett, Brunson, and Randle; 35% closes them off. How confident are you that he’s the former and not the latter?

**Hopeful Hal**: I bet your nephew hates you.",Sikatanan,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17vwk7v/is_rj_barrett_tricking_us_an_analysis/

17vxuq6,2023-11-15 08:50:24,Tyrese Haliburton might be the modern day Steve Nash,"Currently after 10 games Haliburton has been having a career year averaging 24.7 points and a league high 12.5 assists per game. He’s also doing this while only having 2 turnovers per game and an insane 67% true shooting percentage ( His regular shooting numbers are also ridiculous with 52.8 FG% - 43.6 3P% - 93.2 FT%)

At this moment in time the Pacers have the highest Offensive rating in the league and Haliburton is the engine that has this team humming. He has the highest Offensive Rating in the NBA and the second highest Offensive Box-Plus Minus only behind, you guessed it, Jokic. He also has the highest assist percentage in the league at 50.6%, for reference Nash in 07’ had an assist percentage of 50.1%.


I just feel like his impact is on the path to be a version of Steve Nash where he’s facilitating the entire teams offense while still being aggressive himself yet still uber efficient. We all know that Nash is one of the most efficient players ever. I mean the guy has the most 50-40-90 seasons in nba history but a lot of us wondered how it would look if Nash decided to jack up just a few more shots. The most FGA Nash has ever shot was 13.4 attempts with 4.3 of them coming from the 3. Now enters Tyrese Haliburton where after 10 games is taking 16.3 attempts with 7.8 of those attempts coming from the 3 point line. 

We don’t see too many traditional points guards coming into the NBA anymore but Tyrese fits this hybrid role where he blends the 3 points revolution along with the traditional point guard role very seamlessly. I just feel like we’re watching someone similar to Steve Nash but with more of a green light to shoot. Now I know it’s still early in his career and this is only a 10 game sample size but to be fair Tyrese is only 23 years old and will only continue to get better.

17w1rjh,2023-11-15 11:39:37,"Besides Nikola Vucevic only 4 other players managed to average the same pts/reb/ast stats 2 seasons in a row: DeAndre Jordan, Aaron Williams, Jared Jeffries and Olumide Oyedeji","Shoutout to /u/MrStanko83 for finding this gem: **“After averaging 17.6/11.0/3.2 for both 2021/22 and 2022/23 seasons, Nikola Vucevic is currently averaging 17.6/10.9/2.9”**. In his post he asks:

>“Have there ever been historically similar cases?”.

The answer is YES, but none so impressive. After scouring data through seasons 1950/51 – 2022/23, I found only 4 other players matching average stats for 2 seasons in a row, totaling:

 

|Player|Pts|Reb|Ast|Games|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nikola Vucevic (2021/22)|17.6|11.0|3.2|73|
|Nikola Vucevic (2022/23)|17.6|11.0|3.2|82|
|DeAndre Jordan (2015/16)|12.7|13.8|1.2|77|
|DeAndre Jordan (2016/17)|12.7|13.8|1.2|81|
|Aaron Williams (2002/03)|6.2|4.1|1.1|81|
|Aaron Williams (2003/04)|6.2|4.1|1.1|72|
|Jared Jeffries (2008/09)|5.3|4.1|1.4|56|
|Jared Jeffries (2009/10)|5.3|4.1|1.4|70|
|Olumide Oyedeji (2000/01)|1.5|2.2|0.1|30|
|Olumide Oyedeji (2001/02)|1.5|2.2|0.1|36|

 

There are no more players doing this for more than 2 seasons, but some are pretty close. A problem with such statistic as almost repeating averages is the lower numbers are, less variability there is, so someone doing close to 0/0/0 season after season is really consistent, but not eye catching. Therefore next we will look for someone with at least 25 cumulative (pts+reb+ast) average while being as persistent as it gets.

17vjvf1,2023-11-14 18:55:21,Duncan Robinson has tied his last season's total of 2-point field goals made (25) just 11 games into the season,"After the win against the Hornets tonight, Duncan Robinson has tied his last season's total of 2-point field goals made (25) just 11 games into the season. 

Last year 81% (192/237) of his shots were 3pt attempts. Only making 25 2pt field goals on 45 attempts.

This year so far 66.6% (80/120) of his shots are 3pt attempts. 25 2pt field goals made so far on 40 attempts.

Duncan Robinson so far this season has been a lot more comfortable putting the ball on the floor and attacking the basketball. He has added a cutting element into his game that we saw glimpses of late into the Boston Celtics Eastern Conference matchup last year ",20BeersDeep,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17vjvf1/duncan_robinson_has_tied_his_last_seasons_total/

George was whistled for a technical foul for arguing with the referees that he was fouled on a breakaway dunk attempt he missed late in the second quarter.

>""I thought we played great,"" George said. ""It's tough, the adversity of playing against the extra three [officials]. I thought they were awful. But, [against the] defending champs, we got to play better. There's a lot to be positive about. I'm not one for moral victories, but I thought we showed more of a sign of a team tonight that's close to getting it over the hump.""

>It was bad,"" George said when asked about how the game finished. ""Five free throws is very disrespectful on this night. So many times I got hit on layups, 3-pointers, it was constant.

>""Jump shots, getting hit, smacked on the forearm. I mean, it was poor, a poor job. But, again, we got to be able to beat these guys on their floor and not rely on that. Again, they [are] calling something on one end, they got to call it on the other.""",OnlyMamaKnows,40,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38901762/paul-george-calls-officiating-crew-clippers-lose-close-game-nuggets

On the other hand, a franchise level player candidate has to play better even without not-so-optimal pieces.

17vnje3,2023-11-14 22:28:59,Ty Lue has several outdated coaching tendencies and has made several mistakes in his tenure that have cost the Clippers games. Is he really the guy to coach the Clippers?,"I want everyone to know right off the bat that this isn't just an overreaction to tonight's game. It's been a culmination of multiple things since Ty Lue took over for Doc Rivers:

# Overplayed Marcus Morris. 

To an extreme detriment may I add. Only those who watched closely were aware. Clippers fans speculated that Ty and Morris were having a love-affair by how much he got preferential treatment over the other players on the roster. 

# Underplayed Nicolas Batum.

Took him forever to realize Batum should've been the starter at PF. But, of course, he makes the change too late and the Clippers find themselves with less than 25 games to acclimate to not only Batum starting, but the new acquisitions of Russell Westbrook and Mason Plumlee at the deadline.

# Put Robert Covington in DNP jail.

For some reason Ty was against playing Covington. No clue why. His shooting has regressed a bit, but his perimeter defense is still at a high-level (at least higher than Morris'). And we see by Ty's willingness to play Tucker that he doesn't really care about playing an offensively-stunted PF so why did Covington never get a fair shot? In the time he'd get minutes he'd show some flashes of brilliance all to get 5 DNPs right after that. 

# Waited too long to include Terance Mann in the rotation.

Clippers fans were crying for this for weeks. Possibly months. Maybe years (since his big game against Utah in the playoffs)? Mann seemed to be the swiss-army guard that the Clippers needed. He allowed for the right mix of ball-handling duties to be split between Mann, Kawhi and George (so the two stars can be involved in almost every play). Playing him at guard instead of forward allowed him to overwhelm smaller guards defensively. Oh yeah and, for a stretch before acquiring Westbrook, they were undefeated with Mann starting at PG. But Ty Lue (and apparently the front office and the two stars) are obsessed with the idea of a traditional guard. There were games where Mann played 10 minutes because Reggie Jackson and John Wall had to get their minutes at PG.

# Same with Luke Kennard.

Clippers fans were calling him Nuke Kennard, but Lue was calling him Luke Warm. Ty Lue would barely play him, but when he did he played him at SF next to Reggie Jackson and John Wall who would brush him off to take bad shots. But injuries forced Ty Lue's hand. He had to play Kennard minutes at PG and they were stellar. I remember seeing an insane stat that was like ""the Clippers are +78 in Kennard's minutes at PG."" But he never went back to it when George and Leonard were both in the lineup. Instead his low utilization of Kennard led the front office to believe he was a ""bad contract"" and shipped him off for an expiring Eric Gordon. Which, to add insult to injury, led to the inclusion of the draft pick that eventually became Cam Whitmore.  

# Over commitment to small-ball.

This has bit them in the ass more times than I can count. Morris at C against Embiid, Batum at C against Anthony Davis, Paul George at C against Jokic. It's exhausting. Ty Lue seems to want everyone to guard one position up. If you're a PG, get ready to be put on LeBron James. If you're a SG, get ready to guard Giannis Antetokounmpo. Small-ball works at a championship-level when your offense is lethal (Durant-era Warriors) or everyone on the floor is at least 6'7 or taller and at least somewhat defensively-inclined. You can't do it with 3 guards on the floor, PJ Tucker, and Moussa Diabate.

If OKC doesn’t straight up own their pick through 2027, they have the right to swap, so tanking is completely off the table. The Harden trade was a desperate move, and they’ve made themselves a worse team, and have put their future in an even bleaker position in the process. Philadelphia controls their ‘28 and ‘29 picks as well. 

All LAC can really hope to do is to try and move PG/Kawhi at the deadline/offseason and get some level of draft capital back so they have something to look forward to other than an OKC pick in the twenties every other year.

If they’re dead set on trying to improve their roster, who can they even move? It’s clear that they need to get bigger, but what do they have of value that they’d be willing to move? Norman Powell?

Among players with more than 75 field goals attempted, which is currently the top 137 players in the NBA, he is currently leading the league with a 69% TS. Not to mention, both him and the Jays along with Jrue have great chemistry and they have been abusing smaller defenders on the post through mismatch or KP would find JB through a back door cut or when he is double teamed, he would find the right pass for a wide open 3. His passing has been impressive even tho he doesn’t generate a lot of assists.

0/4 3P

9/14 FT

Pascal's continued 3-point struggles aside, one couldn't ask much more from Siakam in a far too close for comfort win against the Wizards that felt like him, Gradey Dick and to a lesser extent Malachi Flynn and Jakob Poeltl were the only ones to show up until the 4th quarter.

It really cannot be understated how much of a mistake it has been for the front office to not commit to Pascal Siakam and watch his supporting cast disappear season after season, to say nothing of the questionable replacements, trades and roster construction since the bubble i.e. getting a non-shooting center to take away space to operate in the paint.

17vzb1l,2023-11-15 09:53:19,"With these rules for drafting, could you make a team that sweeps the 2017 Warriors?","Some context. I had this conversation with my dad about what team was the greatest in the history of the NBA, and by the end we agreed that there was probably no team in the league’s history so far that could beat them in a best of 7 series.

Then we got to talking about what it would take to beat a team like that, with everyone performing at their peak. Obviously, a team of Lebron, Magic, MJ, Kareem, and Duncan would wipe the floor with them, but that much talent on a roster is obviously overkill, so we came up with some rules to try and figure out a starting 5 of all time great players that could beat them without going overboard. From there, the conversation and challenge shifted to something more difficult, beating arguably the greatest team of all time in a 4 game sweep.

Rule 1: You are allowed to draft a singular consensus top 10 all-time player. 

Rule 2: You are allowed to draft a singular consensus top 20 all-time player. 

Rule 3: You can draft any other 3 players outside of the top 75. (When we were doing this, we just used the NBA’s top 75 all time team, with some exceptions, like Jokic, Luka, Dwight Howard, and DRose.)

Rule 4: You can’t draft anyone on that Warriors team.

What I think is a compelling part of this challenge is that you need to account for different play styles and how they can beat mesh to not just beat but dominate one of the league’s greatest teams ever. 

What we came up with was this: 

PG - Tony Parker
SG - Vince Carter
SF - Lebron James
PF - Pau Gasol
C - Nikola Jokic

At this point, I do consider Jokic a top 20 all time player, which is why I picked him. In my opinion, the way you beat a team like the KD Warriors requires you to out offense them without compromising defense. I do think that the combined efforts of Lebron, Jokic, and Gasol would be effective at limiting the scoring trio of KD, Curry, and Klay to something more manageable, and put them in a good spot to overpower them offensively. Speaking of which, all the players listed are more than capable passers, and minus Pau, are all reliable 3 point shooters. The team’s offensive schemes would be designed around maximizing ball movement so as to to set up clear and open shot opportunities. Lebron would probably be handling the ball the most, and would be extremely adept at driving the ball towards the basket before kicking it out to one of his teammates, who would either pass to a more open shooter or take the shot themselves. I can see this team putting up points more reliably than KD and Steph would be able to shoot 3’s.

What do y’all think, and what teams would you guys make to sweep this warriors team?",iCE_P0W3R,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17vzb1l/with_these_rules_for_drafting_could_you_make_a/

This is not a positive, for the record.  That the Raptors have had such significant offensive struggles to consistently dig themselves into these 20+ point holes in both game's respective first half - not to mention the holes they've dug for themselves in other games this season - exemplifies the lack of shooting and struggles with generating offense in the halfcourt, and the lack of O.G. should not be an excuse for Toronto giving up over 60 points in the 1st half to a Wizards team struggling to find its identity.

# What to make of this data 

Taking the career PPG leaders and getting the adjusted TS% (TS+) can give you a good idea who the best scorers in NBA/ABA history are. However, this does not account for pace or minutes played in a game. More work would have to be done to normalize for PER 36 minutes or PER 100 possessions stats. 

The career PPG leaders also only accounts for regular season games and not playoff games. This should also be taken into account if you want to debate who the best scorers in NBA/ABA history are. Also, primes or best 5-year stretches are not taken into account for. Players who started off on the bench (Giannis, Kobe, etc.) or players who played way past their scoring prime (Wilt, Dirk, MJ, Kobe, Barkley, etc.) will be ranked much differently than their best 5-year stretch. 

Active players are listed in **bold** and their numbers will change with more games played. This data is accurate for games played before 11/13/2023. 

Finally, there are [Rate statistic requirements](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/rate_stat_req.html). 

**TS+ formula: 100\*\[TS%/league TS%\]. Career total weighted by seasonal TSA (True Shooting Attempts)** 

# Some takeaways

* Wilt has the best combination of volume and efficiency 
* Would you take KD's \~3 less PPG in exchange for 7 higher TS+ against MJ? 
* Jerry West was underrated as a scorer 
* Oscar Robertson had higher volume and efficiency than Steph 
* Steph barely edges Kareem in volume, but they have the same efficiency 
* Adrian Dantley had higher volume and efficiency than Charles Barkley 
* David Robinson had higher volume and efficiency than Dirk Nowitzki ",Professional_Day6571,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17uubk3/alltime_career_ppg_leaders_and_their_relative_ts/
17vor2t,2023-11-14 23:55:54,Major Flaw w/ In Season Tournament Tie-breakers,"It’s unlikely to get to this point, but there is a major flaw in the NBA’s In Season Tournament tie-breaker rules.

The 1st tie-breaker is h2h games, the 2nd is point differential, the 3rd is total points, but the 4th?

**Regular Season Record** ***LAST SEASON***

It’s inexplicable to me why they wouldn’t have just made it current regular season winning percentage at the time all teams finished group play. Obviously, the likelihood it gets to that point is pretty slim. The 2nd and 3rd tie-breakers will settle 99.99% of ties. But I just don’t understand the thinking on the NBA’s part with this one. Here’s the official tie-breaker language from NBA.com:

> In the event two or more teams are tied within a group, the tie among the teams will be broken according to the following tiebreakers (in sequential order):

  >• Head-to-head record in the Group Stage;
  • Point differential in the Group Stage;
  • Total points scored in the Group Stage;
  • Regular season record from the 2022-23 NBA regular season 
> • Random drawing (in the unlikely scenario that two or more teams are still tied following the previous tiebreakers).",holyrolodex,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17vor2t/major_flaw_w_in_season_tournament_tiebreakers/

In the comments of that post I saw some people wanting era-adjusted pace and peak rather than career stars so I thought I'd do this!

All stats including league average TS% are from Basketball Reference

For players currently in their peak I'm counting the current season in addition to 5 others rather than counting it as a full season

**LeBron James(2012-2018):** 36.8 points/100 on +7.4% relative TS

**Kevin Durant(2013-2019):** 38.0 points/100 on +9.3% relative TS

**Stephen Curry(2016-2022):** 39.5 points/100 on +8.4% relative TS

**James Harden(2015-2021):** 40.2 points/100 on +6.9% relative TS

**Michael Jordan(1987-1993):** 42.6 points/100 on +5.4% relative TS

**Kobe Bryant(2006-2012):** 39.2 points/100 on +2.0% relative TS

**Shaquille O'Neal(1997-2003):** 38.4 points/100 on +6.1% relative TS

Note that modern superstars in the 3 point spacing era are generally more efficient, even compared to league average, than superstars of the past were

Through 9 games this year, Deandre Ayton is averaging .3 free throw attempts per game. You are not reading that incorrectly, there is a decimal in front of the 3.  

He has attempted 3 total free throws with 86 shot attempts on the year so far.  

Ayton has never been known to get to the line as he's never averaged more than 3 FTA per game in his entire career, but is there a precedent for a center playing 31+ minutes per game shooting decimal point free throw attempts? 

This stat just seemed kind of insane to me. Is he just not playing around the rim at all with Portland?",pp21,175,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17uf8q3/deandre_ayton_is_averaging_3_free_throw_attempts/

17ul04f,2023-11-13 13:10:25,[Hollinger] Week That Was: 76ers don't need James Harden; do the Clippers?,">Perhaps some of this can be blamed on the suboptimal spacing resulting from LA’s insistence on starting Russell Westbrook next to its three high-usage stars — allowing teams to keep an extra defender in the paint and gum up any pick-and-roll. Memphis started Jaren Jackson Jr. on Westbrook, and he was largely unconcerned with Russ firing away from the corners. The Clippers evened up the 3-point scoreboard late by playing five smalls in their fourth-quarter run and inserting Norman Powell for shooting, but it’s unclear if that is sustainable for an entire game.

>Yet in those game four games, the Clippers aren’t much better or worse with Westbrook off the court, and for the season, his impact stats are strongly positive. The same can’t be said of Harden, with one number in particular sticking out — a comatose 98.0 pace factor in his minutes. The Clippers have long needed to play faster and were finally getting there in the opening games of the season, but now they’re back in the mud.

>“He’s being too nice,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said about Harden, and there might be a kernel of truth to that given his piddling 17.7 usage rate. Nonetheless, he seemed unusually unable to gain advantages off the dribble Sunday, even when he had seemingly favorable matchups.

>That included one particularly sad sequence where he couldn’t get a shot off against Santi Aldama, gave up the rock, got it back and, on his second try, barely got off a contested 3 that was way short. Also notable in that sequence was that the Grizzles never felt compelled to send help; three years ago, that was an emergency double-team.

>How Clippers fans should feel about that play, and the Harden move in general, largely rests on the knife edge between whether you consider Harden “rusty” or “washed.” Harden clearly isn’t in peak basketball shape right now but also looks slower and less shifty and explosive. How much of that is fixable in the coming days and weeks?",OnlyMamaKnows,51,https://theathletic.com/5056407/2023/11/13/james-harden-clippers-76ers-tyrese-maxey-nba/

No. 1 in total steals (13)

No. 3 in total deflections (21)

No. 3 in total loose balls (8)

No. 7 in total points & assists

In 21.9 mins per game

This is 1st team all rookie material! 

18th draft Jaime jaquez , also known as Juan Wick, is taking Herro injury to get minutes and his production is increasing a lot ! 

His Defense is already top tier ! 

So what u guys think , 1st team all rookie or not ? 2nd maybe?

17v09ni,2023-11-14 03:28:32,Dame and Giannis: +/- over 8 games,"There seems to be a starling (though perhaps not unsurprising) pattern when comparing Dame and Giannis's +/- .

So far this season, Dame has average more minutes (nearly 4) than Giannis (33.25 v 29.6).

However, Giannis +/- is standing at 3.75, whereas Dame's is in the negative: -6.75

&#x200B;

Outside of their very first game of the season (in which the +/- differential was in favor of Dame by 25 points), Giannis's +/- has been more than (or in one case equal to) Dame's. 

In fact, despite the fact that Giannis was behind 25 points after the first game, there is a 10.5 differential in +/- between the two in favour of Giannis (it would be 15 if the first game were not counted). 

See a break down in the table below. 

So how does one explain this or account for this? What are the reasons for such a drastic differential given that the two share most of their minutes together and despite the fact that there is such a small differential in the minutes played (3.6)?

Thoughts?

Tyus was one of the preseason dark horses for Most Improved Player due to his ability to step up in Ja Morant's absence last season where he [produced averages of 16/4/8 on 50/41/77 splits](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=tyus+jones+as+a+starter+grizzlies+22-23) in his 22 games as a starter. In this stretch, he got six 20/10 double-doubles and ten double-doubles overall.

As of right now, despite starting all 9 games, he has not managed to reach 8 assists even once this season, and his scoring has topped out at 16 points, which he has reached twice.

17u97la,2023-11-13 04:06:26,r/nba Playoff MVPs: 1992,"Throughout most of its history, the NBA has annually granted Most Valuable Player Awards to recognize its best competitors in the regular season and in the NBA Finals. These are the most substantial honors that an NBA player can receive. And since 2022, two Conference Finals MVPs have also been awarded each year to further celebrate achievement in the postseason. 

Unfortunately, though, there has never been an award for the most valuable player in the entirety of the playoffs. For the vast majority of the league’s history, the only individual postseason award was entirely based on one series and only available to one team. As a consequence, some of the most incredible performances in the history of the sport have gone without any official recognition. So this project intends to retroactively celebrate some of those performances by asking this subreddit to award [Playoff MVPs](https://imgur.com/a/ghu9LJ6) for every playoff tournament from 1980 to the present.

#How to Vote    

I will provide three different comments beneath each post representing three Playoff MVP candidates for the season being discussed. Additionally, if anybody feels that another player is deserving of candidacy, they can add a comment for that player to nominate them for the award using the process described in the following section. You can reply to these comments with arguments for or against any of the players to convince other voters of your position. Whichever player has the most upvotes after five days will be declared the Playoff MVP of that year, which will be announced the following week.

#Nominating Players

If you would like to nominate a player, simply post a comment for that athlete using the same format as the comments for the other candidates. This should include the player’s name and a link to the Basketball Reference page of the team that they played for that season. Here is an example that you can copy:

PMVP Candidate: **J.R. Smith - [Stats and Record](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2016.html)**

#Voting Criteria

Since the NBA doesn’t have any official criteria for how the MVP is decided, I’m not going to provide any specific criteria for this award either. However, I will suggest that voters judge the playoff MVP by the same standards that they use to judge the regular season MVP, such as individual statistics, team success, and overall impact on the game.

17t6514,2023-11-11 14:46:55,Proof that Shaq had 322 dunks in his rookie season,"Been digging into dunk stats recently. Less because I'm interested in dunks, more because I'm interested in this weird sorta data anomaly.

Officially, Rudy Gobert holds the single-season dunk record with 308 dunks in his 2018-2019 season.

Dig a little deeper and you discover that the NBA only started recording dunk stats in 1996. You may note that Shaq was drafted to the Magic in 1992. This means that Shaq's first 4 seasons of dunks don't count.

And then I found this [Topps Frequent Flyer basketball card](https://hoopsong.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-10-14-at-8.57.17-PM.png) that lists Shaq's rookie season dunk total as 322. Seems kinda bonkers. He blew away the record in his rookie season, and it was just mostly forgotten to time? I figured the card was a misprint or something. 

Curious though, I tracked down a copy of the 1993 Sixers Media Guide on EBay. Sure enough, [on page 146](https://hoopsong.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-2-1-jpg.webp), it lists Shaq's 1992 dunk total as 322. It also lists his season high single-game dunk total as 13 (debatably, another record). If you're not familiar with the Sixers Media Guide and Harvey Pollack, this stuff is very reliable.

So now, Dwight Howard is typically credited as the career all-time dunk leader with 2,950 dunks. If you take Shaq's official career dunk total and add just that rookie season total, you get 2,948 dunks. Pretty sure he knocked down those 3 dunks and then some in the 3 additional seasons he played before dunk stats were introduced.

I just find this super interesting. We're awfully obsessed with data these days. It's getting to the point where we can analyze an entire playing field at specific timestamps. But for the majority of pro sports history you had to scrape together what you could from newspapers, books and memory. 

And yet, in an attempt to frame discussion and debate in NBA media, it's convenient to just dismiss the numbers that you can't bring up on bballreference. And I get that we have to draw the lines somewhere, but this is data collected and printed by a very highly regarded NBA employee who basically set the bar for statistical analysis in the NBA. 

There's a similar story that comes up with the triple-double debate. Long story short, Wilt probably had more triple-doubles than Westbrook by a lot, and they were almost all on blocking. But there's much less proof of that one.",Select-Resource4275,11857,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17t6514/proof_that_shaq_had_322_dunks_in_his_rookie_season/

17t8695,2023-11-11 16:25:04,Derek Fisher owns a seemingly unbreakable NBA record,"We all know about the obvious unbreakable NBA records. John Stockton's career assist and steals totals, LeBron's potential scoring record wherever that ends up, Michael Jordan having 10 scoring titles, ones like that. However, I stumbled across another seemingly unbreakable record currently owned by Derek Fisher, a record that is far less prestigious than the aforementioned ones.


This is a list of the 5 players with the most career games shooting under 30% from the field:


- Derek Fisher, 425

- Jason Kidd, 364

- Robert Horry, 352

- Jamal Crawford, 339

- Brian Shaw, 321


As you can see, the gap between 1st and 2nd place is pretty large, and it's by far the largest gap anywhere on this list. The closest active player to Fisher in this state is PJ Tucker, the 2nd (I think) oldest player in the NBA, currently at 253 games. There's not a single player on a trajectory to even come close to Fisher's mark. The closest that I can find is Marcus Smart, who at 29 years old currently in his 10th season is at 174 games, but he would need to continue playing at his current rate for another like 15+ years in order to reach Fisher's mark.


Combine all that with the fact that the NBA today is more efficient than ever before, and I think it's safe to say that Derek Fisher's NBA record of most career games shooting under 30% from the field will never be broken.",Camctrail,2316,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17t8695/derek_fisher_owns_a_seemingly_unbreakable_nba/

Just no idea why Griffin wants an aggressive trapping type defense on a team with so many older players.

17u0bqn,2023-11-12 18:11:47,Intentional Fouling to Protect Teammates: Is This Common in the NBA?,"Hello r/nba,

I want to discuss something I saw in today’s Nuggets vs. Rockets game, specifically around the 6:00 minute mark in the fourth quarter. Aaron Gordon of the Nuggets got past Aaron Holiday of the Rockets. As Gordon went for the basket, Dillon Brooks from the Rockets stepped into the driving lane. But then, Holiday seemed to foul on purpose just as Gordon and Brooks went up for the shot.

It looked like Brooks would have been called for the foul, but Holiday's last-second foul seemed intentional, as if to take the foul himself. This made me wonder:

1. Have you seen other cases where a player fouls on purpose to prevent a teammate from getting called?
2. Is this a known tactic in the NBA, or just a rare move?
3. Are there other examples of this happening in games?
I'm curious about your observations and examples!

17t0erh,2023-11-11 10:25:36,Alperen Sengun is playing at preMVP Jokic levels while he himself is barely 21 years old.,"Small sample size but so far Sengun has been the best player on the Rockets who are 5-3. He is anchoring a top 10 defense and is the engine of a top 10 offense. He has 19 points, 8.3 rebounds, 6.1 assists to only 2.0 turnovers and has 63.7% TS. Additionally, his advanced stats have been off the rails including WS/48 of .252 and 7.2 BPM which are both top 10 in the NBA. His [on/off +/-numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4879/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) are insane as well on offense and defense.

Nikola Jokic has always been a beast statistically on both sides of the ball even before his MVP seasons and Sengun has matched it so far. Compare Nikola Jokics stats at 24 years old to a 21 year old Sengun's stats and they are pretty neck and neck. Jokic has better FT%, 3%, rebounding but Sengun has better TS%, and assist/TO ratio. 

Jokic will likely be a top 15 nba player when it is all said or done and the chances of Sengun being that just aren't likely. Jokic was pretty stagnant for 4 years before he suddenly took a leap his MVP season and there is no guarantee that Sengun will hit that leap either. There is no guarantee that Sengun keeps playing as good as he has either for the whole year but even if he doesn't he should still get credit for the fact that he played so good so far. 

Sengun doesn't have the height of Jokic but Sengun is much more athletic. I have never seen Jokic nearly his head on the backboard while doing a [chase down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3c0pwXR23Y&t=168s) block 2 feet out of the restricted area. Sengun had 77 dunks last year, Jokic had 21. Sengun had 70 blocks last year, Jokic had 47. There is no numbers that prove one player is more athletic than another but these numbers suggest Sengun is the more explosive athlete.

I was conflicted as whether or not I should talk about Sabonis in this thread but I will, I think preMVP Jokic is better than Sabonis. There should be a new meme were preMVP Jokic is Charizard and MVP Jokic is mega Charizard while both Sengun are Sabonis are Charmeleon instead of [this](https://twitter.com/JTGatlin/status/1615411184966184960)",StudentMed,1066,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17t0erh/alperen_sengun_is_playing_at_premvp_jokic_levels/

But they still have 2 max contract guys in Bane and JJJ. Plenty of teams miss their star play and play fine. An example this year is the Kings missing Fox for 70% of their games, and they are chugging along fine. When the Grizz missed Ja a lot last year, they actually had a better W/L with Tyus Jones at helm.


I'm not expecting them to be a top 5 seed or anything. But 1-8??? The worst team in the league?? They've also had the easiest schedule in the league with playing the Blazers 2x, Jazz 2x, and Wizards (1-5 in those games). They gave Desmond Bane a $210 mil max contract to lead their team to a 1-8 start?

17sxwhh,2023-11-11 08:24:34,How the 76ers have fixed themselves,"Something that I was not expecting to see this year after all the Harden drama was Philadelphia playing maybe the best basketball of the Embiid era to this point. The offense is firing, the defense is stout and Philly was a cunt hair away from being 8-0 after a narrow loss to Milwaukee in their first game.

I’m not an expert on all things basketball, but I have been tuning in to Philly games and have noticed a few things that really stand out.

#1. Points In The Paint

We’re operating with a small sample size so far, so a lot of these numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, I don’t believe it’s a fluke that Philly’s points in the paint are up 8% from last year. In 22-23 the Sixers got 46.8% of their points in the paint, this year they are up to 54.8%. We have seen an equal decline in their points off of the three ball as well.

All of the Philly ball handlers seem to making aggressive drives getting to the rim. Oubre, Harris and Maxey are not shy to attack the basket when the defense allows them to. Which is a perfect segway into my next point.

#2. Tobias Harris Glow-Up

Tobias Harris is playing great basketball so far this season. The main area of notice for me is that Harris’ catch and shoot numbers are down significantly from last year. In 22-23, 35.6% of his shots were catch and shoot, this year, that number is down to 24.2%. He’s also averaging about 1.2 more dribbles per shot attempt as well.

Harris has rediscovered his abilities as a shot creator and it has allowed him to have a much larger impact on the floor. We’re seeing him beat guys off the dribble, score in the post and still maintain his 3 ball, especially in the right corner.

#3. Maxey-Embiid Two-Man Action

Watching what these two guys are doing together reminds me a lot of what Jokic and Murray were doing in the playoffs last year. This version of Maxey is what Philly thought they were getting when they acquired Harden. 

The pick n rolls are obviously a bitch and a half to defend, but there’s a deeper level of chemistry with these two this season. Maxey at times is able to get a free lane to the hoop just because of Embiid’s gravity and Embiid can take advantage of the open floor when Maxey is knocking down his threes and stretching the defense.

#Conclusion

The Sixers look great so far and it’s been a joy to watch as a fan of basketball. The moral of the story is get the toxic people out of your life and get your medicine from Nurse and not a Doc.",GovernmentDoingStuff,777,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17sxwhh/how_the_76ers_have_fixed_themselves/

Claxton missed the last 8 games with a high ankle sprain. Despite early estimates putting his return sometime in December, the Nets starting Center is set to make his return tomorrow against the Washington Wizards after only playing one game so far in the Nets season opener vs Cleveland. Dorian Finney-Smith had since taken over Starting Center duties and has seen surprising success in this role.",Evilsj,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17t8e7f/triplett_ben_simmons_left_hip_contusion_is_out/
17ty2rn,2023-11-12 16:20:53,"Rule Breakdown on technicals, flagrants and video reviews.","I don't know how it came to this, but the recent draymond tantrum has lead a lot of people to cherry pick one sentence out of the rule book and use that to attack the refs when they made the right call. I don't even understand how you can believe this if you've ever watched basketball.

The rule in question:

""**An official may assess a technical foul, without prior warning, at any  time**.  A technical foul(s) may be **assessed to any player on the court or  anyone seated on the bench for conduct which, in the opinion of an  official, is detrimental to the game**. The technical foul must be charged  to an individual. **A technical foul cannot be assessed for physical contact when the ball is alive**.""

Seems pretty cut and dry, but what people conveniently leave out is the immediate following line which says:

1. **EXCEPTION: ""Fighting fouls and/or taunting with physical contact. ""**

So yes obviously technicals can be called for live ball contact, and if you've watched a handful of games you have seen it happen.

Now we can move on to the flagrant review process. Mitchell committed a foul on draymond by bumping him 35 feet out. It probably wouldn't even qualify for a flagrant review if draymond didn't react like a donkey and cause an altercation.

Rules on Flagrant Foul replay reviews:

[**Referees may use replay whenever they are not reasonably certain whether a foul meets the criteria for a flagrant foul**.  Previously, the foul had to be called flagrant on the floor in order to initiate instant replay.  The definition for a flagrant foul is:      Flagrant Foul Penalty 1: Unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent     Flagrant Foul Penalty 2: Unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent  When a flagrant foul call is made, referees conduct a review and consider the following:      Whether the foul call be categorized as a flagrant 1 or flagrant 2 (thus ejection) or stay as a common foul or changed to a technical foul     **Whether any other players committed unsportsmanlike acts immediately prior to and/or immediately following the foul.  Based on their review and the criteria, they will assess the appropriate penalty:**](https://official.nba.com/trigger/review-of-called-foul/)

&#x200B;

This game, despite the fact that i loved watching it, was by many definitions a black eye, \~4.5 hours long real time with the last 2 minutes taking over 20 minutes real time. This is testament to the sloppy and physical nature of the game seemingly instigated by Draymond. Immediately prior he had been causing all kinds of headaches for the refs. At 8:26 in the 3rd Draymond crashes down on a Mitchell box out and gets in a bit of a push with his forearm/elbow, not really much but Mitchell called it out, Draymond had drawn (flopped) a charge at 7:23 in the 3rd on Jarret Allen and immediately got up and in his face. A few plays later at 6:39 in the 3rd Draymond is in the corner looking and talking to the Cavs bench completely out of the play.

Looking at all of this and taking into account draymonds history and his actions during the altercation I think its very reasonable to say draymond deserved the technical. If Donovan deserved a Flagrant 1 is much less cut and dry. [On the play in question](https://youtu.be/ABNstWrRa6c?si=uwSeWqNF_h8SY3rB&t=102), which is definitely NOT a take foul, we can see that he makes contact with his core, attempts to get in a somewhat traditional defensive stance, does not run through draymond, and draymond stops and leans back in to him making the contact appear worse.

I would not argue that Mitchell wanted to foul draymond, but that does not change the magnitude of the foul call. We can look at the criteria for Flagrant 1 & 2 above and quickly rule out a Flagrant 2. Unnecessary is a bit ambiguous but tends to be interpreted as dangerous to the recipient, which i just do not see. This is a very standard isolation foul. Draymond moving into the defender has also been a [focus of recent reinterpretations of the rules by NBA refs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tojc0cl680), so i feel on this particular play the refs made a great decision assessing fouls. Draymonds elbow, incessant taunting and fight instigating are 100% detrimental to the game.",PreparationBorn2195,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17ty2rn/rule_breakdown_on_technicals_flagrants_and_video/

Instead  Jokic saught switches on defense. While he did end up with a monster game, he perhaps lost the 1:1 battle against Sengun.

17t0u0p,2023-11-11 10:45:39,Analysis: Don't go 0-2 in the In-Season Tournament,"I had a question last night of whether an 0-2 team in the IST is already eliminated.  They're not, but their path to the bracket is very steep indeed.

# How Might the Groups Shake Out?

There's ten wins to go around per group, and these are all of the ways they can be distributed in the end that I'm aware of:

A: 4/3/2/1/0

B: 2/2/2/2/2

C: 3/2/2/2/1

D: 4/2/2/2/0

E: 4/3/1/1/1

F: 3/3/2/2/0

G: 3/3/2/1/1

As far as I can tell, any other distribution is impossible for one of a few reasons:

* There can't be two 4-win or 0-win teams, of course.  Everyone plays each other, so only one team can be undefeated or winless.
* Similarly, a 4/3/3 at the top, or 1/1/0 at the bottom, is impossible.  Firstly, that would force two undefeated/winless teams on the other side.  And secondly: in the 4/3/3 example, the 4-win team gave everyone a loss, so it's impossible for two teams to only have one loss to get 3 wins (and the logic is the same for the 1/1/0).

So, that's how I came up with these possibilities.  I worked it out by starting with every way the top two spots can shake out (4/3, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2, 3/3) and then reasoning out how the bottom can work given those constraints.

# The Path to the Group Win

The only scenario above where an 0-2 team can win the group is scenario B.  The 0-2 team needs to win their last two games (of course) and also hope that every team in the group is tied in the end.  I don't have any simulations which tell me how likely it is, but it strikes me as being a bit of a long shot.  Of course, the 0-2 team would also have to win their remaining games by a large enough margin to win the point differential tiebreak across the whole group.

But while lots of hoops would need to be jumped through here, the group win might actually be the easiest path to the playoffs after starting 0-2.

# The Path to the Wildcard

In scenarios B, C, and D, it's possible to get second in a group by going 2-2.  So the 0-2 team would have to win their remaining games, hope that scenario B/C/D happens in their group, and get a good enough PD tiebreak to get the #2 spot in the division (so the 2nd best PD out of 5 2-2 teams in scenario B, or the best out of three 2-2 teams in scenarios C and D).

However, the kicker is that you would also need the *other* two groups to be in configurations B, C, or D, creating to other second-place teams with 2-2 records.  And you'd also need *your* 2-2 team to win the PD tiebreak over *those* other 2-2 second place teams.

So the bottom line is that the 0-2 team would really have to run up the score with point differential, and hope that not just their group, but the other two in their conference, align just right to accommodate the possibility of a 2-2 team winning the wild card.",bluecjj,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/17t0u0p/analysis_dont_go_02_in_the_inseason_tournament/

17u6yue,2023-11-13 01:24:18,What are your thoughts on foul baiters/floppers and the state of refereeing?,"I never used to like guys like Damian Lillard & Darius Garland because of the way they foul bait. Some people say “don’t foul them then”, but the truth is they are looking for the foul. I love the way Kyrie, Steph, Jokic etc. play the game. 90% of the time they genuinely going for the basket and sometimes get fouled. 

But after watching these guys who play the game fair get fouled and not get the calls, I now understand the foul baiters/floppers like Embid. It’s almost like you not gonna get the call if you don’t sell it. I don’t judge LeBron for his antics or Doncic for complaining out there every night. It’s tough. 

There’s too much disparity between the refereeing & the players in terms of punishment. I Know this has been said multiple times already but there needs to be accountability too for and from the refs.

17t5eaw,2023-11-11 14:12:51,Why does Zion refuse to take a midrange or shot from 3?,"I'm a Pelicans fan but am getting pretty sick of watching Zion not take a midrange shot let alone a 3 point when the opportunity's there. He does his drive through the middle thing in every situation even regardless. I understand that part of it is trying to draw a foul, however many times he just fumbles and drops the ball or falls over. What's your take on his strategy and do you think he'd be better taking the midrange or 3 in a lot of situations instead? I'm just a casual fan and not an expert on the game and strategy, so It would be great to hear other people's perspective on this.

17sjg1y,2023-11-10 17:28:37,Just realized Kyle Kuzma and Jordan Poole have had the EXACT same career arcs,"Both were late first round picks (Kuz 27th, Poole 28th). Both missed the playoffs their first two seasons. Both played alongside (arguably) the top 2 players of this generation in LeBron and Steph. Both contributed to the California teams they began their careers with to win a ring in their third seasons. Both followed up their championship runs with a disappointing fourth season. Both were traded after their fourth season because of said disappointment. Both were sent to Washington. Both were involved in deals to trade for a veteran point guard (Kuz for Russ , Poole for CP3).

Dont get me wrong, hes not the same player he used to be, hes not that athletic anymore, he was an electric slasher and dunker and cant get to the rim as much anymore. He used to be an above average defender and now he cant guard a snail.

But beyond that hes always been a very good jump shooter, he can shoot in catch and shoot, shoot off the dribble, shoot mid range. He has sick handles and is a good secondary bench playmaker if your main guy is  doubled.

I think the raps and wizards did wrong by him, he needs the ball in his hands and they didnt do that.

Tonight he went for 29/6/10/4/1 with ZERO turnovers bringing his season totals to an absurd 59 assists to zero turnovers for an A:TO of 7.4.

What makes his lack of turnovers even more impressive is when you combine Maxey's 7.4apg with his 25.9ppg scoring average. He's handling the ball a ton looking to both score and pass at a high level and maintaining perfect control of the ball. When you then add his 61%TS on top of it, he's been a holistic model of efficiency.

17suncg,2023-11-11 05:43:14,2 The Wilt Rules: How Wilt Chamberlain was defended by the 60s Celtics Film Breakdown,"thread: (Film Breakdown)

The Wilt Rules: How Wilt Chamberlain was defended by the 60s Celtics.

For this thread, I will be going over the defensive concepts that Auerbach’s Celtics created to try and defend the NBAs most dominant player.

The general idea of the Celtics defensive scheme was to limit the amount of post touches Wilt received.

They figured if they could deny him the ball, then the rest of his teammates on the floor wouldn’t be able to beat them.

Film Breakdown:

Now when sifting through the film this is a common defensive strategy I see teams use against Wilt:

(Footage from the 1967 Finals 76ers vs Warriors)

Jeff Mullins leaves Wali Jones wide open to front and take away the post entry to Wilt:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265642863554560

Former Warriors player and coach Al Attles in an interview described it as having “a man in front of Wilt, and a man in the back of Wilt.”

Red Auerbach being the first known NBA coach to organize and fully maximize this double team concept.

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265734949474307

There are many examples of the early Celtic teams employing this coverage in available footage.

The Celtics often had K.C. Jones drop back and stand directly in front of Wilt on the block. The idea was to force non-threats like Guy Rodgers to shoot:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265773352546311

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265812598583302

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265852599652355

This time Frank Ramsey quickly threatens the entry pass:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265881351647235

Havlicek immediately takes away the entry pass in transition:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265909533175813

Tom Sanders threatens the entry pass baiting rookie McCoy McLemore into shooting from 20 feet out:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265930181746698

Here the Celtics use K.C. Jones as the designated doubler, meaning that when Wilt received the ball K.C. immediately left his man to double team:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381265986804801540

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266042094116868

This possession goes to show just how great Wilt was, absorbing the double team and banking a fadeaway shot over Russell:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266101217026049

It’s also worth noting that illegal defense is being played here in some of the clips.

Remember, illegal zone defense did exist in the 60s. Wilt claims that it was never called, one ref telling him he hadn’t called a no-zone ruling in two years and wasn’t going to start now.

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266106527051778

The quick double and entry pass denying was relatively effective for keeping the ball out of Wilt’s hands.

Due to poor spacing and lack of playmakers surrounding him, it was often easy for Celtic players to help and rotate.

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266156007292940

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266194863255552

In this play Heinsohn shows his terrific help instincts by playing free safety and anticipating the post entry pass to Wilt, resulting in a steal:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266225867591684

Similar situation here with Wilt in the post, but this time Russell fronts and Heinsohn is prepared to help off Nate Thurmond.

A careless pass from Wayne Hightower ends up as an easy steal for Russell:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266266359353347

Plays like this where Guy Rodgers ignores Wilt down low with a 1 on 1 matchup really highlights the poor decision making and lack of offensive structure:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266332579110913

Here Wilt gets great post position on Russell but it quickly goes to waste as Wayne Hightower launches a contested outside shot:

https://twitter.com/WiltStats/status/1381266377193844739

Whenever Wilt was able to receive the ball on the block he was absolutely devastating 1 on 1.

Getting to his spots on the floor and usually, the lack of shot contests from Russell made it easier for him to score:

Wilt displays active, quick hands and good anticipation. He would have a lot more steals if every opposing big took the challenge of playing him 1 on 1 as Kareem does here:

It feels like the NBA is only doing this to increase the excitement of the regular season, because of all the load managing and good teams not giving maximum effort etc.
